# General_DNN_no_framework
This project is built for learning pruposes to get familiar with the Neuarl Networks architecture and to gain a profound understanding of the process from buidling a shallow network to building Deep Neural Networks with different activations functions, normalization, generalization,optimization techniques.
The core of this project is built using Python, numpy only and without using Machine Learning frameworks.
